    <h1>Reducing Food Waste: A Guide to Sustainable Eating</h1>
    
    <h2>Understanding the Problem of Food Waste</h2>
    <p>Food waste is a global issue, with millions of tons of edible food discarded every year. This not only wastes valuable resources but also contributes to environmental problems such as greenhouse gas emissions and landfills overflowing with wasted food.</p>
    
    <h2>Why Reducing Food Waste Matters</h2>
    <p>By cutting down on food waste, we can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Save money by making the most of the food we buy.</li>
        <li>Help reduce environmental impact by lowering methane emissions from landfills.</li>
        <li>Support food security by redirecting excess food to those in need.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Practical Ways to Reduce Food Waste</h2>
    <p>Here are some effective strategies to minimize food waste:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Plan Your Meals</strong>: Create a weekly meal plan and shop with a list to avoid impulse purchases.</li>
        <li><strong>Store Food Properly</strong>: Keep perishable items in the right conditions to extend their shelf life.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Leftovers Creatively</strong>: Transform leftovers into new meals instead of throwing them away.</li>
        <li><strong>Understand Expiry Dates</strong>: Know the difference between "Best Before" and "Use By" dates to prevent unnecessary waste.</li>
        <li><strong>Compost Scraps</strong>: Convert food scraps into nutrient-rich compost for your garden.</li>
        <li><strong>Donate Excess Food</strong>: Give surplus food to local food banks and charities.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>How Businesses Can Help Reduce Food Waste</h2>
    <p>Restaurants, grocery stores, and food producers can take steps to cut waste by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Partnering with food rescue organizations.</li>
        <li>Implementing portion control to minimize leftovers.</li>
        <li>Offering discounts on near-expiry products to encourage purchases.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Conclusion: Take Action Today</h2>
    <p>Reducing food waste starts with small, conscious efforts. By making smarter choices at home and in businesses, we can collectively create a more sustainable future. Start todayâ€”because every bite counts!</p>
