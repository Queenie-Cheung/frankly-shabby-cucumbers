    <h1>Frankly Shabby Tomatoes: The Beauty of Imperfect Produce</h1>
    
    <h2>What Are Frankly Shabby Tomatoes?</h2>
    <p>Tomatoes are expected to be round, smooth, and perfectly red. But in reality, many tomatoes grow with wrinkles, cracks, or unusual shapes. These <em>frankly shabby tomatoes</em> may not meet supermarket beauty standards, but they are just as juicy, flavorful, and nutritious as their more uniform counterparts.</p>
    
    <h2>What Makes a Tomato "Frankly Shabby"?</h2>
    <p>A tomato might be considered "shabby" if it has:</p>

        <li>Uneven ripening with multiple colors</li>
        <li>Soft spots or wrinkled skin</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These imperfections usually result from natural growth conditions, weather fluctuations, or minor blemishes during harvest. However, they don’t affect the taste or quality of the tomato itself.</p>
